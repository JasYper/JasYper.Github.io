    <td>I think recapping on the previous lesson also helped us to remember how to print words. As I did last week working well with my partner helped both of us to learn and complete much more. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I need to be quicker setting it up as this always limits our time using the fuze box and therefore we don't get as much done in the amount of time we have. We could also practise doing this. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time we will try to set up our Fuze box together to save time and this will let us have more time practising the actual work. Next time we will also try to complete more of the assessments in the book</td>
