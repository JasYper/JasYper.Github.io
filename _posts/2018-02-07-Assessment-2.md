    <td>I mostly learnt this week through reading and studying the instruction book hard. I did this because we split up and took turns trying different parts of the new topic. I found the book very helpful and realised it was a good source for when we split up.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to work quicker and therefore aim to get more done during the lesson. I think I may not of got as much done this week as I was on my own and had to rely more on the book.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time as I have said, I will aim to get more done by working more quickly and I will try to finish the current stage by the end of next lesson. My partner and I will do this together for more speed.</td>
