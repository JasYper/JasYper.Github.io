    <td>I used the book and mainly copied that to complete the work. I also understand a lot more of the programming now and could use a lot of logic in my work to improve the existing coding.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think me and my partner did not cooperate very well in this lesson as I think I did most of the work without him. Also I did ask a lot of questions and sometimes did not know what was going on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to work better with my partner and encourage him to do more of the work. This way we will both improve and help each other improve and fix mistakes they can not see themselves.</td>
