    <td>This lesson we took it in turn to work on the exercises and the other could help improve the work and focus more on our blogs. I think this was helpful because we could both do the work and do things more independently. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Although working separately did help us improve, we did not use as much teamwork in the exercises which we have been doing other weeks. However, when we do the assessments we will work together. </td>

    <td>Next time we might work together or we could work separately again. I think we should vary so we work together and sometimes work separately. This will help us achieve independence as well as teamwork. </td>
