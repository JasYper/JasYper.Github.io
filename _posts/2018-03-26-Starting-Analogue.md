    <td>I learnt through teamwork mostly as well as through the teachers help to understand certain aspects of the work. Also, the book provided a lot of help but was unclear at times.</td>

    <td>In this lesson, we could not find the right components so this delayed us so we could not finish the Analogue section. We did not have an LDR (light dependent resistor) and so had to find one.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time we will make sure we have the right materials before starting the topic so we do not have to start looking part way through the lesson and we will check multiple boxes before asking for help.</td>
