    <td>I learnt through the instructions, hints and examples on the python screen. I also got help from my partner and he got information from me when we were both stuck on a particular section of work. I think restarting the section at a new half term also was a good idea.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think in future I will always read the instructions and examples in more detail so I am not confused later on in the topic like I was this week. Next time I will go faster as I was not used to python as I had not practised over the weekend.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will read the instructions multiple times to check before I move on to the next stage. Next time there is half term I will try to practise what we are doing so I am not as confused in the first lesson back.</td>
