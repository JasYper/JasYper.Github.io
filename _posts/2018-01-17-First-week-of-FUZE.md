    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Me and my partner mainly learnt through reading the instruction booklet and from our previous knowledge from other lessons of how to set it up. We also learnt through working as a team</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think since we had a cover teacher he could not tell us how to improve and what to do if we were struggling. Instead we had to just work with the booklet which told us what to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time the teacher will be here (hopefully) and we can ask him questions but other than that I don't think I need to improve from much else as it was a very simple lesson this week.</td>
