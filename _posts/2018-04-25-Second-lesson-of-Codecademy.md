    <td>This lesson I once again almost entirely learnt through the instructions on codecademy and by using some of the hints they provide. I also learnt through exploration of different keywords and punctuation as I did last time. This time I also learnt about gates from the teacher.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think nothing confused me but the work is getting harder and I am now having to go back and re-read the instructions and explanation to correct errors mostly on my punctuation and spelling. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will go slower to read the instructions more carefully so I do not have to go back and check them again. I will also try to improve my skills on the other aspects on python that I have already completed.</td>
